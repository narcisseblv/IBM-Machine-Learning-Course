# Rainfall Prediction Project
## Overview

Rainfall prediction is a critical application of weather forecasting, especially for agriculture and disaster preparedness. In this project, we explore various machine learning algorithms to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow based on a number of meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

The project is designed to follow the principles of the IBM Machine Learning course, and is a demonstration of key topics such as:

* Data cleaning
* Feature engineering
* Model training
* Model evaluation
